# Automatic-Professional-Portrait-Creator
This is a project to *automate* the manual processing of photos of students taken to put on feels to overcome the difficulty of processing due to students with different heights such that the camera can be fixed still and no need of manual processing to adjust the face to the centre.  This is done using automatic cropping, resizing. The background of the photo is to be removed and replaced with the respective color of the faculty.
